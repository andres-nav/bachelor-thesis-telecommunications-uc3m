#+title: Design and Implementation of a Distributed Parking Management System
#+setupfile: ~/git/templates/org/thesis/setupfile.org

* Abstract
In this project I have designed, developed and implemented a fully distributed system for managing multiple communities. In each community there is a independent server that runs a ML model to detect. The main idea behind this is to create a system where each community has a fully independent sytsem for manaing their garage where users can allow or deny the access to specific cars.

This project has been done in collaboration with the Automation department.
