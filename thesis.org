* Introduction
** General understanding and relevance of parking management systems
In recent years, the exponential increase in the number of vehicles has exacerbated urban challenges, notably in parking management. For instance, the surge in car usage in Madrid has significantly contributed to increased pollution levels [cite:@environmental_imapct_madrid_central]. Despite a stable number of parking spaces in Spain between 2014 and 2020 [cite:@urban_mobility_trends], the demand has led to higher costs and greater difficulty in securing parking, thereby increasing time spent searching for spaces, traffic congestion, and urban pollution.

Current parking management in Spain predominantly relies on human intervention, where personnel are responsible for regulating access to parking spaces. This manual approach often results in delays, inadequate information dissemination, and inefficient control over parking availability.

Advancements in technology offer promising solutions to these issues. The proliferation of internet-connected devices, which have grown by 20% year-over-year [cite:@iot_growth], has facilitated the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-based parking management systems. These systems aim to mitigate traffic congestion and reduce pollution in urban areas.

A parking management system (PMS) is designed to optimize the utilization of parking spaces within a city, community, or building. The primary objectives of a PMS include automating parking space management, recording vehicle transit, and enhancing overall operational efficiency.

PMSs provide numerous benefits in modern urban settings. They contribute to reducing traffic congestion and pollution, thereby improving urban mobility and the quality of life for residents. Additionally, PMSs enhance security by monitoring vehicle movements within parking areas, which aids in crime prevention.

These systems share several common features:
- Automation of parking space management.
- Application in various areas such as cities, communities, or buildings.
- Documentation of vehicle transit within parking spaces.

The integration of PMSs into urban infrastructure not only addresses parking-related issues but also aligns with broader smart city initiatives aimed at enhancing urban living conditions.

** Motivation
Parking management systems remain a critical area of research and development, even though manual parking management has been utilized for many years. Research published in [cite:@parking_choices] indicates that the type of parking management system significantly influences the parking choices of citizens. Additionally, citizens tend to prefer systems that are user-friendly, secure, and reliable.

Currently, parking management systems in Spain largely rely on human intervention, leading to several issues such as delays in availability, lack of information, and insufficient control of parking spaces. Continuous human presence is required to maintain the functionality of these systems throughout the day, which increases operational costs.

To address these issues, recent technological advancements have emerged. For instance:
- RFID-based smart parking management systems [cite:@rfid_smart_parking_management_system] have been developed to manage the transit of vehicles within parking spaces.
- IoT-based smart parking management systems [cite:@development_smart_parking_management_system] have been designed to manage parking spaces within a community.
- Intelligent parking systems utilizing image processing [cite:@intelligent_parking_system_image_processing] have been proposed to recognize license plates of parked vehicles.

Despite these advancements, several challenges persist. Current parking management systems are typically centralized, which presents scalability and reliability issues in the event of service interruptions. Additionally, these systems often lack customization options, making it difficult to adapt to user-specific needs.

Given these challenges, the primary objective of this project is to design and implement a fully distributed parking management system that addresses the limitations of current systems, focusing on enhancing scalability, reliability, and user adaptability.

** Overview of Parking Management Systems
Parking management systems have evolved significantly over the decades, adapting to the increasing demands of urban environments and technological advancements. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the historical development of parking management systems, examining their origins and progression. It also explores modern trends that have emerged in response to contemporary urban challenges and technological innovations. Additionally, it addresses the ongoing challenges faced by these systems, highlighting the areas that require further development to meet the needs of smart cities.

*** Historical Development
The evolution of parking management systems (PMS) has been driven by the increasing urbanization and the consequent rise in the number of vehicles. In the early stages, parking management was rudimentary, primarily involving manual interventions where attendants managed parking spaces and collected fees. This manual process was time-consuming and often inefficient, leading to issues such as congestion and disputes over parking spaces.

The introduction of mechanical parking meters in the 1930s marked a significant milestone in parking management. These meters automated the fee collection process, thereby reducing the need for human intervention and providing a structured approach to managing parking spaces. However, the system still had limitations, including the inability to monitor parking space occupancy in real-time and the need for regular maintenance and collection of fees.

The 1970s and 1980s saw the advent of computerized parking management systems, which leveraged early computing technologies to offer more sophisticated solutions. These systems introduced features such as centralized control, automated ticketing, and basic reporting capabilities. Despite these advancements, the systems were still relatively inflexible and often required significant manual oversight.

With the rise of the internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s, parking management systems began to incorporate web-based functionalities. This period witnessed the development of online reservation systems and the integration of electronic payment options. These innovations improved user convenience and operational efficiency, yet they were still predominantly centralized systems, which posed challenges in terms of scalability and resilience.

*** Modern Trends and Challenges
In recent years, the landscape of parking management systems has been transformed by advancements in technology, particularly the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI). Modern PMS are now equipped with a range of smart features designed to enhance user experience, optimize space utilization, and reduce operational costs.

One of the key trends in contemporary parking management is the integration of IoT devices. These devices, which include sensors and smart cameras, provide real-time data on parking space occupancy and vehicle movements. This data enables dynamic pricing models, where parking fees are adjusted based on demand, thereby optimizing revenue and space utilization. IoT-enabled systems also facilitate real-time navigation assistance for drivers, reducing the time spent searching for parking spaces and subsequently decreasing traffic congestion and emissions.

Another significant trend is the use of big data analytics. By analyzing large volumes of data generated by IoT devices, parking management systems can gain insights into usage patterns, peak times, and user preferences. These insights are invaluable for urban planners and parking operators, allowing them to make data-driven decisions to improve infrastructure and services.

AI and machine learning are also being increasingly incorporated into PMS. These technologies enable predictive analytics, which can forecast parking demand and optimize space allocation accordingly. Additionally, AI-powered systems can enhance security through advanced video analytics that detect suspicious activities and automate enforcement actions such as issuing fines for violations.

Despite these advancements, several challenges persist. One of the primary issues is the scalability of current systems. Many existing PMS are centralized, meaning that a failure in the central system can disrupt the entire operation. Distributed systems, which spread processing and data storage across multiple nodes, offer a potential solution to this problem, providing greater resilience and scalability.

Another challenge is the need for interoperability between different technologies and systems. The diversity of devices and communication protocols used in modern PMS can lead to compatibility issues, complicating integration efforts. Standardization of protocols and interfaces is crucial to ensure seamless operation and data exchange between different components of the system.

Security and privacy concerns are also significant challenges. The extensive use of IoT devices and data analytics in parking management raises the risk of cyberattacks and data breaches. Ensuring robust security measures and compliance with privacy regulations is essential to protect user data and maintain trust in the system.

In conclusion, the historical development of parking management systems has been characterized by a gradual shift from manual processes to sophisticated, technology-driven solutions. Modern trends such as IoT integration, big data analytics, and AI are driving significant improvements in efficiency and user experience. However, challenges related to scalability, interoperability, security, and privacy must be addressed to fully realize the potential of these advanced systems in the context of smart cities.

#Introduction
## General understanding and relevance of parking management systems
In recent years, the exponential increase in the number of vehicles has exacerbated urban challenges, notably in parking management. For instance, the surge in car usage in Madrid has significantly contributed to increased pollution levels [cite:@environmental_imapct_madrid_central]. Despite a stable number of parking spaces in Spain between 2014 and 2020 [cite:@urban_mobility_trends], the demand has led to higher costs and greater difficulty in securing parking, thereby increasing time spent searching for spaces, traffic congestion, and urban pollution.

Current parking management in Spain predominantly relies on human intervention, where personnel are responsible for regulating access to parking spaces. This manual approach often results in delays, inadequate information dissemination, and inefficient control over parking availability.

Advancements in technology offer promising solutions to these issues. The proliferation of internet-connected devices, which have grown by 20% year-over-year [cite:@iot_growth], has facilitated the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-based parking management systems. These systems aim to mitigate traffic congestion and reduce pollution in urban areas.

A parking management system (PMS) is designed to optimize the utilization of parking spaces within a city, community, or building. The primary objectives of a PMS include automating parking space management, recording vehicle transit, and enhancing overall operational efficiency.

PMSs provide numerous benefits in modern urban settings. They contribute to reducing traffic congestion and pollution, thereby improving urban mobility and the quality of life for residents. Additionally, PMSs enhance security by monitoring vehicle movements within parking areas, which aids in crime prevention.

These systems share several common features:
- Automation of parking space management.
- Application in various areas such as cities, communities, or buildings.
- Documentation of vehicle transit within parking spaces.

The integration of PMSs into urban infrastructure not only addresses parking-related issues but also aligns with broader smart city initiatives aimed at enhancing urban living conditions.

## Motivation
Parking management systems remain a critical area of research and development, even though manual parking management has been utilized for many years. Research published in [cite:@parking_choices] indicates that the type of parking management system significantly influences the parking choices of citizens. Additionally, citizens tend to prefer systems that are user-friendly, secure, and reliable.

Currently, parking management systems in Spain largely rely on human intervention, leading to several issues such as delays in availability, lack of information, and insufficient control of parking spaces. Continuous human presence is required to maintain the functionality of these systems throughout the day, which increases operational costs.

To address these issues, recent technological advancements have emerged. For instance:
- RFID-based smart parking management systems [cite:@rfid_smart_parking_management_system] have been developed to manage the transit of vehicles within parking spaces.
- IoT-based smart parking management systems [cite:@development_smart_parking_management_system] have been designed to manage parking spaces within a community.
- Intelligent parking systems utilizing image processing [cite:@intelligent_parking_system_image_processing] have been proposed to recognize license plates of parked vehicles.

Despite these advancements, several challenges persist. Current parking management systems are typically centralized, which presents scalability and reliability issues in the event of service interruptions. Additionally, these systems often lack customization options, making it difficult to adapt to user-specific needs.

Given these challenges, the primary objective of this project is to design and implement a fully distributed parking management system that addresses the limitations of current systems, focusing on enhancing scalability, reliability, and user adaptability.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this bachelor thesis is to design and implement a fully distributed parking management system tailored for the next generation of smart cities. This project aims to address the inefficiencies and challenges inherent in current parking management systems through a distributed approach that leverages modern technologies.

Specifically, the objectives of this project are as follows:

1. *Research Current Systems*: Conduct a comprehensive study of existing parking management systems, identifying their main problems. This involves understanding user requirements, analyzing the technologies employed, and evaluating system effectiveness.

2. *Technology Analysis*: Analyze the technologies currently used in parking management systems to determine their suitability for a distributed architecture. This includes examining sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, communication protocols, and data processing methods.

3. *System Infrastructure Design*: Design the overall infrastructure of the distributed parking management system. This encompasses defining the system architecture, selecting appropriate technologies, and developing detailed design specifications.

4. *System Development*: Develop the system by adhering to a structured methodology that includes phases of planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase will follow best practices to ensure the system's robustness and efficiency.

5. *Performance Analysis*: Evaluate the implemented system based on various criteria such as performance, scalability, security, usability, reliability, availability, and cost. This comprehensive analysis will help in assessing the effectiveness of the system and identifying areas for improvement.

Through these objectives, the thesis aims to contribute to the advancement of smart city technologies by providing a scalable, secure, and user-friendly parking management solution. The distributed nature of the proposed system is expected to enhance its performance and reliability, making it a viable option for modern urban environments.
