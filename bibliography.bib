    NUMBER = {1},
    PAGES = {141--162},

    ABSTRACT = {Smart city initiatives are being promoted across the world to
                address major urban challenges, and they all share a common
                belief in the transformative power of digital technologies.
                However, the pace of innovation in smart cities seems to be much
                slower than the rapid and profoundly disruptive transformations
                brought about by digital innovation in many other domains. To
                develop new insights about the main causes behind this relatively
                modest success, this study provides a Systematic Literature
                Review (SLR) on the connection between major smart city
                challenges and the essential properties of digital innovation.
                The review involved the qualitative analysis of 44 research
                papers reporting on smart city innovation practices and outcomes.
                The results characterize five major challenge categories for
                smart city innovation: Strategic vision; Organizational
                Capabilities and Agility; Technology Domestication; Ecosystem
                Development; and Transboundary Innovation. This study also
                explores the connections between these challenges and concrete
                digital innovation practices in smart city initiatives. The main
                conclusion is that current innovation practices in smart cities
                are not properly aligned with what the research literature
                commonly describes as core properties of digital innovation and
                that this might be a major cause behind the limited progress in
                smart city initiatives.},
