Automated parking management systems have evolved significantly to address the unique needs of residential communities. Currently, various types and technologies are employed in modern parking management solutions, focusing on their application in community settings. Sensor-based systems utilize advanced sensing technologies, such as ground sensors embedded in pavement and overhead sensors mounted above parking spaces, to monitor and manage parking spaces efficiently. These sensors provide real-time data on occupancy, enabling efficient space utilization and reducing search times for residents.

\gls{lpr} systems have gained popularity in community parking management, offering advantages such as automated access control, visitor management, and enforcement of parking regulations. \gls{rfid} technology provides another efficient solution, particularly beneficial for large residential complexes with multiple parking areas. Mobile application-integrated systems offer residents a user-friendly interface to interact with the parking system, providing features like real-time availability information, digital permits, and reservation capabilities.

Cloud-based management platforms have revolutionized parking management by offering centralized, scalable solutions with real-time data analytics, remote management capabilities, and enhanced security. Smart gate systems, integrated with other parking management technologies, form a crucial component of modern community parking solutions, enhancing security and ensuring smooth traffic flow.

The choice of parking management system for a residential community depends on factors such as the size of the community, budget constraints, and specific parking challenges. Often, a combination of these technologies is employed to create a comprehensive, efficient, and user-friendly parking management solution tailored to the unique needs of each community. As urban populations continue to grow and vehicle ownership increases, these advanced parking management systems will play an increasingly important role in optimizing space utilization, improving resident satisfaction, and contributing to more sustainable urban environments.
