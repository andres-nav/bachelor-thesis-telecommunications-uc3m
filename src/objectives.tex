\chapter{Objectives}\label{ch:objectives}

The primary objective of this bachelor thesis is to design and implement a fully distributed parking management system tailored for the next generation of smart cities. This project aims to address the inefficiencies and challenges inherent in current parking management systems through a distributed approach that leverages modern technologies. The objective of this project can be broken down into the following specific goals:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Conduct a comprehensive study of existing parking management systems, identifying their main problems and inefficiencies. This involves understanding user requirements, analyzing the technologies employed, and evaluating system effectiveness.

  \item Analyze the technologies currently used in parking management systems to determine their suitability for a distributed architecture. This includes examining sensors, \gls{iot} devices, communication protocols, and data processing methods to identify the most suitable technologies for the proposed system.

  \item Design the overall infrastructure of the distributed parking management system. This encompasses defining the system architecture, selecting appropriate technologies, and developing detailed design specifications to ensure a scalable, secure, and user-friendly system.

  \item Develop the system by adhering to a structured methodology that includes phases of planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase will follow best practices to ensure the systemâ€™s robustness, efficiency, and reliability.

  \item Evaluate the implemented system based on various criteria such as performance, scalability, security, usability, reliability, availability, and cost. This comprehensive analysis will help in assessing the effectiveness of the system and identifying areas for improvement.

  \itemDeploy and test the proposed system in a real-world scenario, such as a city center with high vehicle density and limited parking spaces, to validate its effectiveness and identify potential issues.
\end{itemize}

By achieving these objectives, the thesis aims to contribute to the advancement of smart city technologies by providing a scalable, secure, and user-friendly parking management solution. The distributed nature of the proposed system is expected to enhance its performance and reliability, making it a viable option for modern urban environments.
