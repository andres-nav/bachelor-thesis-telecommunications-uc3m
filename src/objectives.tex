\chapter{Objectives}\label{ch:objectives}

The primary objective of this bachelor thesis is to design and implement a fully distributed parking management system tailored for the next generation of smart cities. This project aims to address the inefficiencies and challenges inherent in current parking management systems through a distributed approach that leverages modern technologies.

Specifically, the objectives of this project are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Research Current Systems}: Conduct a comprehensive study of existing parking management systems, identifying their main problems. This involves understanding user requirements, analyzing the technologies employed, and evaluating system effectiveness.

  \item \textbf{Technology Analysis}: Analyze the technologies currently used in parking management systems to determine their suitability for a distributed architecture. This includes examining sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, communication protocols, and data processing methods.

  \item \textbf{System Infrastructure Design}: Design the overall infrastructure of the distributed parking management system. This encompasses defining the system architecture, selecting appropriate technologies, and developing detailed design specifications.

  \item \textbf{System Development}: Develop the system by adhering to a structured methodology that includes phases of planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase will follow best practices to ensure the system's robustness and efficiency.

  \item \textbf{Performance Analysis}: Evaluate the implemented system based on various criteria such as performance, scalability, security, usability, reliability, availability, and cost. This comprehensive analysis will help in assessing the effectiveness of the system and identifying areas for improvement.
\end{enumerate}

Throughthese objectives, the thesis aims to contribute to the advancement of smart city technologies by providing a scalable, secure, and user-friendly parking management solution. The distributed nature of the proposed system is expected to enhance its performance and reliability, making it a viable option for modern urban environments.
