\chapter{Testing}\label{ch:testing}

In order to test the system, first each different subsystem and components is tested individually as described in \cref{ch:methodology_approach}. For this, the database, terminal  server are first tested individually. Then, the system is tested as a whole in a controlled environment to ensure the correct functionality and make sure that they system cover the requirements detailed in \cref{ch:requirements}.

\section{Individual Tests}

\subsection{Database}

The database is a highly important part in the functionality of the system. A robust and properly designed database is needed to ensure the correct gathering of the data and relationships. For this in order to test the database, multiple custom SQL queries are designed to ensure that the edge cases are covered to store specific information. During this part, multiple iterations of the database are designed narrowing down the data categories and ensurin the different data entries have the correct data representation. For example, ensuring that boolean attribues can only allow for 0 and 1 or the number of cars a user is able to have in a specific parking is not negative. By doing this, we ensure that the data stored is correct and no unintended functionality is performed in the data layer.

\subsection{Terminal}

For the terminal, all API endpoints are tested to make sure that they function as expected. Insomnia \todo{ref}, a tool to craft and perform API requests for testing, is used. This is done to ensure the correct functionality of the API and have an example for each API entries for documentation purposes.

\subsection{Server}

For the server, two approches are used to ensure the correct functionality. First, the server is tested grafically and see that the website functions correctly. It is worth to note, that the website is tested to be responsive, that is to be adapted to mobile devices also. This is used using the Responsive Design Mode in the Inspector Tools of Firefox and Google Chrome \todo{add ref}. Moreover, the server is tested in conjunction with the terminal to ensure the correct functinoality between both of them locally.

\section{Controlled Environment Tests}

In order to ensure that the system behaves correctly as a whole, tests are performed on controlled environments, that is a parking place where the system is used to managed
