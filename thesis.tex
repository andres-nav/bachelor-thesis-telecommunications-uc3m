\chapter{General understanding and relevance of parking management systems}
\label{sec:org2e7d34c}
In recent years, the exponential increase in the number of vehicles has aggravated urban challenges, notably in parking management. For instance, the surge in car usage in Madrid has significantly contributed to an increase in pollution levels \autocite{environmental_imapct_madrid_central}. Despite a stable number of parking spaces in Spain between 2014 and 2020 \autocite{urban_mobility_trends}, the demand has led to higher costs and greater difficulty in securing parking, thereby increasing time spent searching for spaces, traffic congestion, and urban pollution.

TODO: explain what is a parking management system

Current parking management in Spain predominantly relies on human intervention, where personnel are responsible for regulating access to parking spaces. This manual approach often results in delays, inadequate information dissemination, and inefficient control over parking availability.

Advancements in technology offer promising solutions to these issues. The proliferation of internet-connected devices, which have grown by 20\% year-over-year \autocite{iot_growth}, has facilitated the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-based parking management systems. These systems aim to mitigate traffic congestion and reduce pollution in urban areas.

A parking management system (PMS) is designed to optimize the utilization of parking spaces within a city, community, or building. The primary objectives of a PMS include automating parking space management, recording vehicle transit, and enhancing overall operational efficiency.

PMSs provide numerous benefits in modern urban settings. They contribute to reducing traffic congestion and pollution, thereby improving urban mobility and the quality of life for residents. Additionally, PMSs enhance security by monitoring vehicle movements within parking areas, which aids in crime prevention.

These systems share several common features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Automation of parking space management.
\item Application in various areas such as cities, communities, or buildings.
\item Documentation of vehicle transit within parking spaces.
\end{itemize}

The integration of PMSs into urban infrastructure not only addresses parking-related issues but also aligns with broader smart city initiatives aimed at enhancing urban living conditions.
\chapter{Motivation}
\label{sec:org1fd61c1}
Parking management systems remain a critical area of research and development, even though manual parking management has been utilized for many years. Research published in \autocite{parking_choices} indicates that the type of parking management system significantly influences the parking choices of citizens. Additionally, citizens tend to prefer systems that are user-friendly, secure, and reliable.

Currently, parking management systems in Spain largely rely on human intervention, leading to several issues such as delays in availability, lack of information, and insufficient control of parking spaces. Continuous human presence is required to maintain the functionality of these systems throughout the day, which increases operational costs.

To address these issues, recent technological advancements have emerged. For instance:
\begin{itemize}
\item RFID-based smart parking management systems \autocite{rfid_smart_parking_management_system} have been developed to manage the transit of vehicles within parking spaces.
\item IoT-based smart parking management systems \autocite{development_smart_parking_management_system} have been designed to manage parking spaces within a community.
\item Intelligent parking systems utilizing image processing \autocite{intelligent_parking_system_image_processing} have been proposed to recognize license plates of parked vehicles.
\end{itemize}

\label{sec:orgda705bd}
The goal of this work is to design and implement a next-generation parking management system for smart cities with the aim of improving the quality of life of the citizens and reducing the traffic congestion and the pollution in the cities.

On the one hand, the citizens will benefit from the system by reducing the time that they spend looking for a parking space and by automating the management of the parking spaces in a community.
Moreover, the system will help to improve the security of the parking spaces by recording the transit of the vehicles in the parking spaces.

This in consequence will increase the quality of life of the citizens as the ease of managing the parking spaces in a community will be improved and the security of the parking spaces will be increased.

On the other hand, the benefits of the system for the city or the communities are also important. The system will save costs by automating the management of the parking spaces and eliminating the need of a person to be present all the time.

Additionally, the system will be able to send automatic alerts to the users when a parking space is available, or when an intruder is detected in the parking spaces.
